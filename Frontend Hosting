#1 Create The Website Frontend Files
This step involves creating and hosting the frontend for the event announcements project using S3 static website hosting.

Overview of the Frontend Code
The frontend consists of three main files:
1) index.html: Provides the structure and content of the website.
- Displays the list of events from events.json.
- Contains a form to create new events.
- Includes a "Subscribe" button to collect user email addresses for notifications.
2) styles.css: Handles the visual appearance and layout.
3) events.json: A JSON file that stores event data, including the event title, date, and description.

Below is a brief explanation of what the main components in index.html do.
Header Section:
- Contains the project title and a "Subscribe to Events" button.
- The subscribeToEvents() function is triggered when the button is clicked.

Events Section:
- Allows users to add a new event with a title, date, and description.
- The form uses the submitNewEvent(event) function to send the data to the backend API.

JavaScript Code:
- loadEvents(): Fetches and displays events from events.json.
- subscribeToEvents(): Sends user email to the backend for notifications via SNS.
- submitNewEvent(event): Sends new event details to the backend API for saving to events.json.

#2 Create an S3 Bucket
Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
Click "Create bucket" & configure Bucket Name (Use a unique name)
Region: Select the same region where your backend services will be hosted (e.g., ap-south-1).
Block Public Access: Disable "Block all public access" so the bucket can be used for static website hosting.
Click "Create bucket".


#3 Upload Website Files to S3
Open the S3 bucket.
Click "Upload", select the files (index.html, styles.css, and events.json), and upload them
Ensure that public-read access is enabled for these files.

#4 Enable Static Website Hosting

In the S3 bucket, go to the "Properties" tab.
Scroll to Static website hosting and enable it.
Select "Host a static website".
Enter index.html as the Index Document and leave the Error Document blank.
Save the configuration.


#5 Set Permissions for Public Access
Navigate to the "Permissions" tab and navigate to the Bucket Policy. Click on Edit.
Add the policy as given below and click on save changes
Note: Replace <YOUR-UNIQUE-BUCKET-NAME> with your bucket name.


#6 Verify the Website
Copy the Bucket Website Endpoint from the Static website hosting settings.
Open the URL in a browser to confirm that the website loads successfully.
