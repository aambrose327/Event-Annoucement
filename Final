#1 Update the Frontend Code

Integrate the API Gateway endpoints into the index.html file by replacing the placeholders with the actual URLs of the /subscribe and /create-event API Gateway endpoints.
Replace the relevant sections of the script in index.html:
Replace <YOUR_SUBSCRIBE_API_ENDPOINT> and <YOUR_CREATE_EVENT_API_ENDPOINT> with the actual API Gateway URLs for the /subscribe and /create-event endpoints, respectively.
Where to get these API Gateway URLs? As mentioned earlier, from your AWS Console navigate to API Gateway → <YOUR_API_NAME> → From the sidebar, goto Stages → Copy the Invoke URL
Now replace <YOUR_SUBSCRIBE_API_ENDPOINT>by <INVOKE_URL>/subscribe and <YOUR_CREATE_EVENT_API_ENDPOINT> by <INVOKE_URL>/create-event

Navigate to the S3 Console:- Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to S3.
Access the Bucket:
- Open the S3 bucket where your website is hosted.
